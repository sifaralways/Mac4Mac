# LogReaderView Crash Fix Implementation

## Problem Analysis

The app was crashing when closing the log viewer due to a race condition between:
1. The async monitoring task accessing file resources
2. The view deallocation during window animation
3. Improper cleanup of file handles and tasks

### Crash Details
- **Location**: `objc_release` in `_NSWindowTransformAnimation dealloc`
- **Root Cause**: Memory management issue during window animation cleanup
- **Address**: `0x000031ba57bec670` (invalid memory region)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added LogReaderCoordinator Class**
- Created a separate `@StateObject` coordinator to manage task lifecycle
- Implements proper cleanup with `deinit` method
- Manages the monitoring task and active state

### 2. **Enhanced Task Management**
- **Graceful Stop**: Added `gracefulStopMonitoring()` method with proper async cleanup
- **Activity Checks**: Multiple checks for `coordinator.isActive` throughout the monitoring loop
- **Timeout**: 0.2-second grace period for task cleanup

### 3. **Improved File Handle Management**
- **Resource Safety**: Explicit file handle cleanup with try-finally pattern
- **Early Exit**: Multiple guard statements to exit early when view is inactive
- **Error Handling**: Ensures file handles are closed even in error conditions

### 4. **Race Condition Prevention**
- **State Coordination**: Uses coordinator's `isActive` flag to prevent race conditions
- **Multiple Checks**: Verifies active state before file operations and UI updates
- **Async Cleanup**: Proper async/await patterns for cleanup operations

## Key Changes Made

```swift
// Before: Direct task management in view
@State private var monitoringTask: Task<Void, Never>?

// After: Coordinator-based management
@StateObject private var coordinator = LogReaderCoordinator()

// Before: Immediate stop
.onDisappear {
    stopMonitoring()
}

// After: Graceful async stop
.onDisappear {
    Task {
        await gracefulStopMonitoring()
    }
}

// Before: Simple file handle usage
let fileHandle = try FileHandle(forReadingFrom: url)
fileHandle.closeFile()

// After: Safe resource management
var fileHandle: FileHandle?
defer { fileHandle?.closeFile() }
guard coordinator.isActive else {
    fileHandle?.closeFile()
    return
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Crash Prevention**: Eliminates the race condition causing the crash
2. **Resource Safety**: Proper cleanup of file handles and async tasks
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Smooth transition when closing the log viewer
4. **Memory Management**: Prevents memory leaks and invalid memory access
5. **Future-Proof**: Robust pattern for similar async operations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Open and close the log viewer multiple times**
2. **Test with rapid switching between tabs**
3. **Monitor memory usage during extended use**
4. **Verify no file handle leaks occur**
5. **Test app quit while log viewer is open**

The fix ensures that the log monitoring task is properly cancelled and all resources are cleaned up before the view is deallocated, preventing the crash that was occurring during window animation cleanup.
